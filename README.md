Simple Interest Calculator

This project is a simple JavaScript application that calculates Simple Interest based on three inputs: principal, rate, and time.

It demonstrates basic mathematical computation, clean code structure, and execution using Node.js.

Formula

Simple Interest = (Principal × Rate × Time) / 100

Where:

Principal (P) is the initial amount of money

Rate (R) is the annual interest rate (percentage)

Time (T) is the duration in years

Features

Calculates simple interest accurately

Clean and readable JavaScript code

Executable using Node.js via CLI

Beginner-friendly and easy to understand

Technologies Used

JavaScript

Node.js

Git (CLI workflow)

How to Run

Clone the repository

Navigate into the project folder

Run the following command:

node index.js

Example

If:
Principal = 1000
Rate = 5
Time = 2

Output:
Simple Interest = 100

Purpose

This project was built to practice JavaScript fundamentals, apply mathematical logic, and strengthen Git CLI workflow skills.
